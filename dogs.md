### Gracie

This is Gracie!  My wife and I adopted her from [Happy Tales Humane](https://happytaleshumane.com)
rescue in Franklin, TN on September 29, 2006.  She was roughly 4 years old at the time.  Gracie was our
travel buddy and came with us wherever we went.  Here she is at the Wingate hotel in Charlotte, NC for the
Mustang 50th anniversary celebration in April 2014.  After a very brave and hard fight with cancer over 18 months, Gracie
passed over the rainbow bridge in April 2016.

### Luba

This is Luba!  My wife and I adopted her from [Do Over Dogs](https://www.facebook.com/DoOverDogs/)
rescue in Broomfield, CO on May 7, 2016.  Her exact age was unknown but she was roughly 13 weeks old at the time.
She is the sweetest, most loving dog we've ever met, and her name (Люба) is Russian for love.  Luba misses the mountains
in Colorado, but she likes North Carolina just fine.  You can follow her on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/luba_means_love/)!
