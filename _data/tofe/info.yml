  The TOFE is a time-of-flight (TOF) detector in the east (E) arm of the PHENIX central
  spectrometer.  It was designed, developed, and assembled at Tsukuba University.  It was
  part of the original design of PHENIX and was successfully operated for all 16 run
  periods.

slat: >-
  The individual component of the TOFE is the slat.  Each slat is a plastic scintillation
  counter made of Bicron BC404 read out on either end with a Hamamatsu R3478S
  photomultiplier tube.

system: >-
  The TOFE system consists of 10 panels.  Each panel contains 96 slats for a total of 960
  slats and 1920 readout channels.  There are eight panels in sector 1 covering the full
  22.5 degrees in azimuth and the full +/- 0.35 units in pseudorapidity, and two panels in
  sector 0 covering full 22.5 degrees in azimuth and the innermost rapidity range.
