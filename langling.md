### Introduction

I absolutely love languages.  This includes, but is not at all limited to, my native
language of English.  There are many languages that have taken hold of my interest over the years.  Below
are some specific pages dedicated to some that have grabbed my attention recently.  If you
do not see your own language, please let me know---if you send me an email with a few
words of your native language, it would really make my day!

### Things language learners should know

There are many branches of linguistics that you should know about, and linguistics is a
very rich and fascinating field of study.  I am by no means an expert, but I
aspire to be a knowledgeable outsider.  However, if you are interested in other languages,
as I am, there are a few key branches you should know about, in no particular order:
**semantics**; **phonology**; **orthography**; **accidence**; **syntax**.
Roughly speaking, we can consider the following correspondences:
**semantics** is about meaning; **phonology** is about pronunciation;
**orthography** is about spelling; **accidence** and **syntax** are about grammar.



#### Orthography

The word orthography comes from Greek "orthos" (correct) and "graphein" (writing).  It
refers to various things, including: the form of individual letters; the means by which
individual letter are combined to form words (viz. this is what is normally referred to as
_spelling_); which letters are capitalized; and which additional symbols are used to convey
additional meaning (e.g. punctuation).

#### Accidence

Accidence refers to the way words change their form depending on the role the play in a
given context.  In English, accidence plays a minor role because the vast majority of
words don't change form at all.  This is the case for not only English, which may be
either a West Germanic language (the majority view) or a North Germanic language (a strong
minority view), but also for Romance languages and others across the world.  These
languages are said to be "weakly inflected", meaning forms change very little.  On the
other hand, other languages, for example the many Slavic languages, are highly inflected,
meaning the words may change form significantly depending on their role.

Consider the words `Ron`, `Luba`, `dog`, and `ball`.  Let's focus on `Luba` in a
few sentences.

Sentence | Explanation
-------- | -----------
Luba is a dog. | `Luba` is the subject.
Ron loves Luba. | `Luba` is the direct object. (`Ron` is the subject, `loves` is the verb.)
Ron gives the ball to Luba. | `Luba` is the indirect object. (`Ron` is the subject, `gives` is the verb, `ball` is the direct object.)

Now, let's translate these sentences into Russian.

Sentence | Explanation
-------- | -----------
Люба собака. | `Люба` is in the nominative case.
Рон любит Любу. | `Любу` is in the accusative case.
Рон дает мяч Любе. | `Любе` is in the dative case.

Notice how the form of `Luba` (e.g. `Люба/Любу/Любе`) changes in Russian depending on the role of the word in the
sentence (highly inflected), whereas in English it's always just `Luba` (weakly inflected).
I'm using 'English-style' word order in Russian to make the parallels clearer---in general,
Russian word order is extremely flexible, but some orderings are more common than others.
In English, on the other hand, the word order is very rigid (more on that later).
It's worth pointing out that in addition to `Ron gives the ball to Luba` it is equally
valid in English to say `Ron gives Luba the ball`.  In both cases, Luba is the indirect
object and ball is the direct object.

Now let's go out a little further to talk about possession, and we'll inadvertently
encounter a bit about prepositions as well.  Possession and plurality are the only
accidence markings on most English words, e.g. `dog` (singular), `dog's` (singular possessive),
`dogs` (plural), `dogs'` (plural possessive).
In Romance languages, possession is not indicated by changing the word (accidence) but rather
by adding a preposition (syntax).
I'll use Spanish as an example:
`la perra` (singular), `de la perra` (singular possessive), `las perras` (plural), `de las perras` (plural possessive).
You may protest that the Spanish word for dog is `el perro`, not `la perra`.
It's quite common for words refering to living creatures to change based on the
gender of the thing in question.  This goes for both professions (e.g. `el profesor`, `la profesora`)
and animals (e.g. `el perro`, `la perra`).  And Luba is a girl.  A very good girl.

Now let's look at a sentence that indicates possession.

Sentence | Explanation
-------- | -----------
Luba's ball is on the table. | `Luba's` indicates possession. (The subject is `ball` or `Luba's ball`, `on the table` is a prepositional phrase.)
Любы мяч на столе. | `Любы` is in the genitive case.  (The Russian word for table is `стол`, `столе` is in the prepositional case.)
La pelota de Luba es en la mesa. | The preposition `de` indicates possession.



#### Syntax

Syntax refers to the way words are combined to convey meaning.  Individual words have their
own meaning, and combinations of words have a meaning that may or may not be the trivial
combination of their individual meanings.

There are many aspects of syntax, but a key one
is word order.  In highly inflected languages, the word order is rather flexible.  In
weakly inflected languages, slight changes in word order can change the meaning.

Consider the English sentence `Ron loves Luba`.  If we change the word order to
`Luba loves Ron` we get a _different meaning_.  If we change it to `Loves Luba Ron`,
`Loves Ron Luba`, `Luba Ron loves`, or `Ron Luba loves`, we get ungrammatical and meaningless sentences.
(It is left as an exercise for the interested reader to verify that there are 3! = 6
possible orderings of a sentence with 3 distinct words.)
Now let's translate the original sentence into Russian: `Рон любит Любу`.
The word `Рон` is in the nominative case, indicating it's the subject,  and the word `Любу`
is in the accusative case (the nominative is `Люба`), indicating it's the direct object.
If we reverse the names, as we did in our first alternate sentence, we get `Любу любит Рон`,
which has the _same meaning_ as the original.  We can also do `Любит Любу Рон`,
`Любит Рон Любу`, `Любу Рон любит`, and `Рон Любу любит`, and we get a grammatical sentence with the same meaning as the original.
If we want to reverse the meaning, we have to change individual words themselves, rather
than the order, to obtain `Люба любит Рона`.  As before, we can use any word order we like,
and the meaning is the same.

#### Spelling and Grammar

What is meant by _spelling_ is usually clear to the casual reader.  But it is hopefully clear that
orthography is not only spelling.  Moreover, there is some overlap between orthography and
accidence, in the sense that the form of words is part of orthography, regardless of their
role in conveying meaning.

What is meant by _grammar_ is also usually clear to the casual reader.  It consists primarily
of accidence and syntax, and occasionally of orthography as well (e.g. a mistakenly added or
ommitted apostrophe is a mistake of orthography, or of both orthography and accidence).

### Descriptive vs prescriptive linguistics

Generally speaking, linguistics is a *descriptive* field, meaning it *descibes* how
languages work, in contradistinction to how one might belive that languages *should* work.
In some cases, individual countries have national academies that actively prescribe the
best practices for the language(s) indigenous to that country.  In other cases, there is
no governing body, and the language evolves freely on its own.

English, for example, is not regulated by any governing body.  There are some widely
acknowledged "style guides", e.g. The Associated Press Stylebook, that make recommendations
about grammar and usage.  Most English language dictionaries, including the Oxford English Dictionary,
are purely descriptive.  For example, use of the word
[literally](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literally)
as an intensifier
rather than to indicate something in actuality is now listed in most dictionaries.
