### Introduction

I absolutely love languages.  This includes, but is not at all limited to, my native
language of English.  I have what I call, for lack of a better term, linguistics
ADD---there are many languages that have taken hold of my interest over the years.  Below
are some specific pages dedicated to some that have grabbed my attention recently.  If you
do not see your own language, please let me know!  If you send me an email with a few
words of your native language, you will make me very happy!

### Things language learners should know

There are many branches of linguistics that you should know about, and linguistics is a
very rich and fascinating field of study.  I am by no means an expert, not at all, but I
aspire to be a knowledgeable outsider.  However, if you are interested in other languages,
as I am, there are a few key branches you should know about: **orthography**; **accidence**;
**syntax**.  Very roughly speaking: **orthography** can be regarded as *spelling*;
**accidence** can be considered as how words change form based on context; **syntax** is more
or less how words are put together to convey meaning (beyond the meaning of invidual words).
The fourth category for language learners to be aware of is paradoxically the most trivial
and the most important: **semantics**.  **Semantics** refers to
the *meaning* of both individual words and combinations of words.

#### Orthography

The word orthography comes from Greek "orthos" (correct) and "graphein" (writing).  It
refers to various things, including: the form of individual letters; the means by which
individual letter are combined to form words (viz. this is what is normally referred to as
_spelling_); which letters are capitalized; and which additional symbols are used to convey
additional meaning (e.g. punctuation).

#### Accidence

Accidence refers to the way words change their form depending on the role the play in a
given context.  In English, accidence plays a minor role because the vast majority of
words don't change form at all.  This is the case for not only English, which may be
either a West Germanic language (the majority view) or a North Germanic language (a strong
minority view), but also for all Romance languages and others across the world.  These
languages are said to be "weakly inflected", meaning forms change very little.  On the
other hand, other languages, for example the many Slavic languages, are highly inflected,
meaning the words may change form significantly depending on their role.

#### Syntax

Syntax refers to the way words are combined to convey meaning.  Individual words have their
own meaning, and combinations of words have a meaning that may or may not be the trivial
combination of their individual meanings.

#### Spelling and Grammar

What is meant by _spelling_ is clear to the casual reader.  But it is hopefully clear that
orthography is not only spelling.  Moreover, there is some overlap between orthography and
accidence, in the sense that the form of words is part of orthography, regardless of their
role in conveying meaning.

### Descriptive vs prescriptive linguistics

Generally speaking, linguistics is a *descriptive* field, meaning it *descibes* how
languages work, in contradistinction to how one might belive that languages *should* work.
In some cases, individual countries have national academies that actively prescribe the
best practices for the language(s) indigenous to that country.  In other cases, there is
no governing body, and the language evolves freely on its own.
