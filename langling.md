### Introduction

I absolutely love languages.  This includes, but is not at all limited to, my native
language of English.  There are many languages that have taken hold of my interest over the years.  Below
are some specific pages dedicated to some that have grabbed my attention recently.  If you
do not see your own language, please let me know---if you send me an email with a few
words of your native language, it would really make my day!

### Things language learners should know

There are many branches of linguistics that you should know about, and linguistics is a
very rich and fascinating field of study.  I am by no means an expert, not at all, but I
aspire to be a knowledgeable outsider.  However, if you are interested in other languages,
as I am, there are a few key branches you should know about: **orthography**; **accidence**;
**syntax**.  Very roughly speaking: **orthography** can be regarded as *spelling*;
**accidence** can be considered as how words change form based on context; **syntax** is more
or less how words are put together to convey meaning (beyond the meaning of invidual words).
The fourth category for language learners to be aware of is paradoxically the most trivial
and the most important: **semantics**.  **Semantics** refers to
the *meaning* of both individual words and combinations of words.

#### Orthography

The word orthography comes from Greek "orthos" (correct) and "graphein" (writing).  It
refers to various things, including: the form of individual letters; the means by which
individual letter are combined to form words (viz. this is what is normally referred to as
_spelling_); which letters are capitalized; and which additional symbols are used to convey
additional meaning (e.g. punctuation).

#### Accidence

Accidence refers to the way words change their form depending on the role the play in a
given context.  In English, accidence plays a minor role because the vast majority of
words don't change form at all.  This is the case for not only English, which may be
either a West Germanic language (the majority view) or a North Germanic language (a strong
minority view), but also for all Romance languages and others across the world.  These
languages are said to be "weakly inflected", meaning forms change very little.  On the
other hand, other languages, for example the many Slavic languages, are highly inflected,
meaning the words may change form significantly depending on their role.

#### Syntax

Syntax refers to the way words are combined to convey meaning.  Individual words have their
own meaning, and combinations of words have a meaning that may or may not be the trivial
combination of their individual meanings.

There are many aspects of syntax, but a key one
is word order.  In highly inflected languages, the word order is rather flexible.  In
weakly inflected languages, slight changes in word order can change the meaning.

Consider the English sentence `Ron loves Luba`.  If we change the word order to
`Luba loves Ron` we get a _different meaning_.  If we change it to `Loves Luba Ron`,
`Luba Ron loves`, etc., we get ungrammatical and meaningless sentences.
Now let's translate the original sentence into Russian: `Рон любит Любу`.
The word `Рон` is in the nominative case, indicating it's the subject,  and the word `Любу`
is in the accusative case (the nominative is `Люба`), indicating it's the direct object.
If we reverse the names, as we did in our first alternate sentence, we get `Любу любит Рон`,
which has the _same meaning_ as the original.  We can also do `Любит Любу Рон`,
`Любу Рон любит`, etc., and the we get grammatical sentence with the same meaning.

#### Spelling and Grammar

What is meant by _spelling_ is clear to the casual reader.  But it is hopefully clear that
orthography is not only spelling.  Moreover, there is some overlap between orthography and
accidence, in the sense that the form of words is part of orthography, regardless of their
role in conveying meaning.

What is meant by _grammar_ is also usually clear to the casual reader.  It consists primarily
of accidence and syntax, and occasionally of orthography as well (e.g. a mistakenly added or
ommitted apostrophe is a mistake of orthography, or of both orthography and accidence).

### Descriptive vs prescriptive linguistics

Generally speaking, linguistics is a *descriptive* field, meaning it *descibes* how
languages work, in contradistinction to how one might belive that languages *should* work.
In some cases, individual countries have national academies that actively prescribe the
best practices for the language(s) indigenous to that country.  In other cases, there is
no governing body, and the language evolves freely on its own.

English, for example, is not regulated by any governing body.  There are some widely
acknowledged "style guides", e.g. The Associated Press Stylebook, that make recommendations
about grammar and usage.  Most English language dictionaries, including the Oxford English Dictionary,
are purely descriptive.  For example, use of the word
[literally](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literally)
as an intensifier
rather than to indicate something in actuality is now listed in most dictionaries.
