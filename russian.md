### Greeting and introduction

Всем приветсвие! Я изучал русский язык в университете, но теперь я забываю все слова.

### I loved you (Pushkin)

Я вас любил: любовь ещё, быть может,<br>
В душе моей угасла не совсем;<br>
Но пусть она вас больше не тревожит;<br>
Я не хочу печалить вас ничем.<br>
Я вас любил безмолвно, безнадежно,<br>
То робостью, то ревностью томим;<br>
Я вас любил так искренно, так нежно,<br>
Как дай вам Бог любимой быть другим.<br>

1829

#### Discussion

Not only is this one of the greatest poems ever
written in any language, it really showcases
the magic and beauty of Russian.

The throughout the poem, he refers to the formerly
beloved using the second person formal pronoun
вы (cf French vous, Spanish ested, etc).  Ordinarily
when speaking to a friend, intimate partner, etc, one
would use ты (cf French tu, Spanish tú, etc).
The use of formal pronouns can be used as a sign of respect,
but it can also be used to maintain a certain level of distance.
Here Pushkin may be trying to distance himself from
his formerly beloved to help soften the pain of separation.
This seems consistent with the very gentle tone throughout the poem.
Indeed, when I read to myself or imagine it spoken, the tone of
voice is so soft as to be almost a whisper.

The first phase is "я вас любил"
meaning simply "I loved you."  The word
вас is the accusitive case (director object) of вы.

The next phrase is one of the longer ones:
"любовь еще, быть может, в душе моей угасла не совсем".
A mostly literal translation
(adjusting for grammatically required word order differences between Russian and English)
is "love still, (it) may be,
in my soul (it) has not died completely".
Russian is a "pro-drop" language, meaning
the subject pronoun is often dropped because
the grammatical form of the verb is completely
unambiguous, so the "it" is implied.  We can pick
either location for it, though observe that the
meaning slightly changes depending on which one.
A slightly more idiomatic translation could be
"it may be that love has not yet completely died in my soul".
Pushkin
eschews the more common "может быть"
in favor of the less common
"быть может",
both meaning either "may be" or "maybe"---this
may be a literary device to indicate shades of meaning,
or it could simply be for the sake of rhyming with
"тревожит" on the next line.

The next phrase is
"но пусть она вас больше не тревожит".
The mostly literal translation of
"but let it not bother you any longer"
is quite close to most literary ones.
Interestingly, Pushkin explicitly uses
она (she/it; note that любовь is grammatically feminine),
even though "но пусть вас больше не тревожит"
would be grammatically correct due to the pro-drop
feature discussed above.  This could make it so
that the "it" is more explicily his "love" rather
than a more generic "it" referring to the overall
situation.  It could also simply be for the sake of
the overall rhythm of the poem.

The final phrase in the first quatrain is
"я не хочу печалить вас ничем."  A literal
translation is "I want to sadden you by nothing."
The word ничем is the instrumental case
(by means of) of the word
ничто (nothing).  A more idiomatic
translation could be "I don't want to sadden you in any way."
Often, more literary translations use "bother"
instead of "sadden" for the word печалить, which
is less literal but a better fit for the overall
tone of the poem.
