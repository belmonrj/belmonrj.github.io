### Greeting and introduction

Всем приветсвие! Я изучал русский язык в университете, но теперь я забываю все слова.

### I loved you (Pushkin)

Я вас любил: любовь ещё, быть может,<br>
В душе моей угасла не совсем;<br>
Но пусть она вас больше не тревожит;<br>
Я не хочу печалить вас ничем.<br>
Я вас любил безмолвно, безнадежно,<br>
То робостью, то ревностью томим;<br>
Я вас любил так искренно, так нежно,<br>
Как дай вам Бог любимой быть другим.<br>

#### Discussion

Not only is this one of the greatest poems ever
written in any language, it really showcases
the magic and beauty of Russian.

The throughout the poem, he refers to the formerly
beloved using the second person formal pronoun
вы (cf French vous, Spanish usted, etc).  Ordinarily
when speaking to a friend, intimate partner, etc, one
would use ты (cf French tu, Spanish tú, etc).
The use of formal pronouns can be used as a sign of respect,
but it can also be used to maintain a certain level of distance.
Here Pushkin may be trying to distance himself from
his formerly beloved to help soften the pain of separation.
This seems consistent with the very gentle tone throughout the poem.
Indeed, when I read it to myself or imagine it spoken, the tone of
voice is so soft as to be almost a whisper.

The first phase is "я вас любил"
meaning simply "I loved you."  The word
вас is the accusative case (director object) of вы.

The next phrase is the longest one, and the only one spanning two lines:
"любовь ещё, быть может, в душе моей угасла не совсем".
A mostly literal translation, adjusting only for grammatically required word
order differences between Russian and English,
is "love still, (it) may be,
in my soul (it) has not died completely".
Russian is a "pro-drop" language, meaning
the subject pronoun is often dropped because
the grammatical form of the verb is completely
unambiguous, so the "it" is implied.  We can pick
either location for it, though observe that the
meaning slightly changes depending on which one.
A slightly more idiomatic translation could be
"it may be that love has not yet completely died in my soul".
Pushkin
eschews the more common "может быть"
in favor of the less common
"быть может",
both meaning either "may be" or "maybe"---this
may be a literary device to indicate shades of meaning,
or it could simply be for the sake of rhyming with
"тревожит" two lines later.

The next phrase is
"но пусть она вас больше не тревожит".
The mostly literal translation of
"but let it not bother you any longer"
is quite close to most literary ones.
Interestingly, Pushkin explicitly uses
она (she/it; note that любовь is grammatically feminine),
even though "но пусть вас больше не тревожит"
would be grammatically correct due to the pro-drop
feature discussed above.  This could make it so
that the "it" is more explicitly his "love" rather
than a more generic "it" referring to the overall
situation.  It could also simply be for the sake of
the overall rhythm of the poem.

The final phrase in the first quatrain is
"я не хочу печалить вас ничем."  A literal
translation is "I want to sadden you by nothing"
or "I don't want to sadden you with anything."
The word ничем is the instrumental case
(by means of) of the word
ничто (nothing).  A more idiomatic
translation could be "I don't want to sadden you in any way."
Often, more literary translations use "bother"
instead of "sadden" for the word печалить, which
is less literal but a better fit for the overall
tone of the poem.

The first phrase of the second quatrain is
"я вас любил безмолвно, безнадежно",
which literally means "I loved you silently, hopelessly"
and the literary translations are generally identical.
The words безмолвно and безнадежно are quite interesting.
The word без means without and is often used as a prefix
to indicate the lack of something, and но is the adverb
suffix.  The root word of безмолвно is молва, which is a
somewhat colloquial word meaning speech, talk, etc.
The root word of безнадежно is надежда, which means
hope, and is also a common Russian first name.

The next phrase is
"то робостью, то ревностью томим".
A mostly literal translation is
"now with timidity, now with jealousy we torment".
The mostly literal translation really fails with
the word томим, which is the first person plural
conjugation of томить. It has a variety of
meanings---to torment; to tire, to bore; to confine
(as in captivity).  It also has a reflexive form
томить, which also has a variety of meanings---to suffer;
to languish (as in captivity); to pine for (with но).
The context indicates that the translation should be
something like
"(I am) tormented now by timidity, now by jealousy".
The word то has a variety of meanings, but the construction
"то X, то Y" means "now X, now Y".
The words робостъ (timidity) and ревность (jealousy)
are both in the instrumental case (by means of, with).
In literary translations, diffidence is often used instead
of timidity.  The meanings in English are quite close,
and diffidence comes across as a bit more artful.
A good idiomatic translation could then be
"tormented now by diffidence, now by jealousy"
or perhaps
"tormented now by diffidence and jealousy".

The next phrase is
"я вас любил так искренно, так нежно"
which means
"I loved you so sincerely, so dearly".
The literary translations are essentially
identical to the literary one.
It's worth noting that нежно can mean
dearly, fondly, and gently, and all three
appear in various translations.  To my ear,
gently best fits the mood of the poem.

The final phrase of the poem is
"как дай вам Бог любимой быть другим."
The mostly literal translation is
"as may God grant you to be loved by another."
Here we really see how flexible Russian word order is,
with the word-for-word translation being
"as may grant you God loved to be by another."
A more English-like wording,
как дай Бог вам быть любимой другим,
is equally grammatical.
The word как is a very simple but very important
Russian word, meaning how, like, or as.
The word дай is an imperative form of дать, meaning
to give or to grant.
The word другим is the instrumental form
of the adjective другой, meaning another;
grammatically, one could also use
другом as the instrumental form of the noun друг.
Primarily, другим appears to be used because it
rhymes with томим two lines earlier.  However, it's
also the case that in addition to "another"
друг can also mean "friend", so the usage of
the adjective eliminates any potential ambiguity.
