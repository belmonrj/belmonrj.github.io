### Greeting and introduction

你们好！我学习中文。对不起，我的中文非常错。

I am primarily learning with simplified characters, as used in mainland China.
I have a very strong appreciate for the history and beauty of traditional characters,
as used in e.g. Taiwan and Hong Kong.  I am trying to learn them as well.
The pinyin keyboard helps a lot, but I recognize there are ambiguities so I am trying
to learn to recognize the connections (some are quite obvious, but some are not).

你們好！我學習中文。對不起，我的中文非常錯。


### 1. The way that can be followed is not the eternal way.

道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名無名天地之始有名萬物之母。故常無欲以觀其妙，常有欲以觀其徵。此兩者同出而異名。同謂之玄。玄之又玄，衆妙之門。
