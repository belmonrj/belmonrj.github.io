### General philosophies

Because I teach at a university, my students are adults and I treat them as such.
You'll find this to be a recurring theme here.

- Attendance: strongly encouraged but not required and not part of the grade.
  - Why strongly encouraged?  Because class time is the best time to see the material, ask questions, and so on.
  - Why not required?  Because students are adults and they can use their time as they see fit.
- Laptop and cell phone usage: unconditionally allowed.
  - Why?  In many cases they have a valid reason, whether it be relating to disability/accessibility
    or because they're waiting to receive an important update (e.g. a relative's chemo treatment).
  - Why else?  Because students are adults and they can use their time as they see fit.
- Camera during online courses: not required.
  - Why not?  Because they may have a good reason not to want the camera to be on; I respect their right to privacy.
- Accepting late work: partial credit no questions asked, full credit if requested in advance or explanation given after the fact.
  - Why?  Well, I mean, why not?  There are times in one's career when deadlines are very hard and need to be respected,
    but oftentimes this is not the case, and the goal of homework, tests, etc is learning, not arbitrary punishment.
- Final exams: never.
  - Why not?  They're extremely stressful for students, and for that reason do not provide an accurate gauge of what they know.
