### General philosophies

Because I teach at a university, my students are adults and I treat them as such.
You'll find this to be a recurring theme here.

- Attendance: strongly encouraged but not required and not part of the grade.
  - Why strongly encouraged?  Because class time is the best time to see the material, ask questions, and so on.
  - Why not required?  Because students are adults and they can use their time as they see fit.
- Laptop and cell phone usage: unconditionally allowed.
  - Why?  In many cases they have a valid reason, whether it be relating to disability/accessibility
    or because they're waiting to receive an important update (e.g. a relative's chemo treatment).
  - Why else?  Because students are adults and they can use their time as they see fit.
- Camera during online courses: not required.
  - Why not?  Because they may have a good reason not to want the camera to be on; I respect their right to privacy.
- Final exams: never.
  - Why not?  They're extremely stressful for students, and for that reason do not provide an accurate gauge of what they know.
- Accepting late coursework: partial credit no questions asked, full credit if requested in advance or explanation given after the fact.
  - Why?  Well, I mean, why not?  There are times in one's career when deadlines are very hard and need to be respected,
    but oftentimes this is not the case, and the goal of coursework is learning, not arbitrary punishment.
- Final submissions for credit: developing based on current experiences, but my plan for the future is an extremely hard
  cut off at 11:59 PM on the first day of finals.
  - Why?  For a variety of reasons, but I respect my own time, and since I don't have any final exams, I'd like to be done with
    the semester as soon as possible.
  - Considering the previous bullet, doesn't this make you a flaming hypocrite?  Short answer: yes.  Long answer: maybe not,
    because some deadlines really are very hard and need to be respected, and this is an important lesson that students need to learn.
    Lines in the sand have to be drawn somewhere.
